<p>The year 2019 is coming to an end, this is a year full of ups and downs for me.<br />
I started a small Internet company last year during spring as a partner, and left this summer. I helped build the startup in the hope that a group of talented engineers could work together to build something new and cool, but it turned out to be a mundane job with a bunch of in-house solutions for outsourced business from big corporates, like CRUD and analytics web apps and wechat integrations. There are endless internal disagreements like intersect holding percentage, arguments between shareholders and parent shareholders, and worst of all, constant moving business target because of the highly customization process. The software development itself is always in a hurry and leaves little time to polish, features are fulfilled before bugs get fixed, changing of product direction is constant and since we as a second party had weak voice over important decisions. This leaves a toxic and pessimistic experience of my professional career. Evidently doing business is hard in China and a good connection can get you contracts no matter what level of technology you can provide.<br />
Luckly I was recalled and re-joined the old company before June, a come-back like this is not easy, it's a land mine of office politics and I had to sail carefully through landmines. The HR lady surely gave me an uneasy look because she wonders why I "deserted". It's funny because the startup business is not my original plan at all and I had little choice because of stupid reasons (again: Guanxi matters). I took the old position, kept the old salary, the jobs left for me were familiar but different. Our team used to be backoffice supporting role for a NASDAQ public company, our service is required to keep the whole user base healthy but most of them are offline computing and does not impact end-user directly or at least not in real-time. The code I left is 60% intact but the rest 40% is much harder to read and maintain, apparently the contributors just keep adding IF branches everywhere as bandit fixes. Refactor the program structure is not easy as a layoff happened some months earlier and everyone works their ass off to keep work up to date with fewer hands available. The higher goals I set before I left were never finished, the number of functions were increased but the system consistency was regressed to a pile of crap. Python 2 end-of-life is imminent but I just stick with miniconda2 forever.<br />
I bought a condo last year at the suburb of the city after won the property-buying-ticket lottery, thus began my lucky and miserable life as a debt payer, the glorious relay in the value chain of the slowed-down property boom. The trade war made the economy suffer, but the interest rate (3.25%) established in 2015 kept rolling. There are rumors that PBOC will switch benchmark for LPR, I honestly have no idea what will happen next. There are good news though, the new condo is delivered this December, ahead of schedule, my family can finally enjoy more space and an extra room for activities.<br />
My child went to first grade of a private primary school this September, the first few weeks was fun, the grind began when first homework was assigned. It was a dark moment for my boy and parents. There are so many gimmcks, everything looks more like reading comprehension than actual problem solving. For Chinese class, studends are required to learn 5 or 10 new words ever lesson but the practice nothing like it, learners have hard to grasp the intension of the tricky quesion. I really miss the good o' days when I was young, the homework requires one to remember and practice the writing of the words I learned at school, just few lines of work and can be done in minutes. The Math class is full of bullshit rote process. A graph showing 8 toys on the left and 8 on the right, asking how many of them in total and a group of 10 toys are required to draw with a circle. Why 10 toys? Later I realized that pupils are expected to remember 8+8==10+6 thus 10 comes first and 6 was added later. WTH? I think 6 year olds are fully capable of remember 8+8==16 and be done with it.<br />
I read very few books this year, as always. Watched significantly fewer movies, played hundreds hours of GTA V and Paladins, started to listen to podcast like Luogic Talkshow. This programme is a meh but it's refreshing to hear what's happenning from a non-technical person's perspective.<br />
Like been said, the 2019 might be the worst year so far, but also the brightest amongst later.</p>
