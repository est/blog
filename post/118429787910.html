  <blockquote>
<p>Steve Jobs's Stanford commencement address, a short talk that he gave in 2005 and which went viral after his death in 2011, is, in many ways, the <em>ne plus ultra</em> of Jobsian wisdom. It encapsulated his thoughts on life, love and death. It expressed his lifelong philosophy and motivation. And it ends with a moving tribute to Brand and what he calls "an amazing publication called the Whole Earth Catalog", which he describes as "one of the bibles of my generation". It's worth quoting the rest of it in full: "It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.</p>
